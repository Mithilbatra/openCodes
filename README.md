# openCodes

This Repo consists of all the main codes that I have done during my Btech. years and will also include the codes I will be doing in the Future. 
It will mainly contain codes in C language because it is my first ever programming language.

## Motive for this Repository

The main reason I created this repository is to show my coding work to others.
